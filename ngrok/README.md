# Plaid Pattern - ngrok

This demo includes [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), a utility that creates a secure tunnel between your local machine and the outside world. We're using it here to expose the local webhooks endpoint to the internet.

Browse to [localhost:4040](http://localhost:4040/inspect/http) to see the ngrok dashboard. This will show any traffic that gets routed through the ngrok URL.

**Do NOT use ngrok in production!** It's only included here as a convenience for local development and is not meant to be a production-quality solution.

Donâ€™t want to use ngrok? As long as you serve the app with an endpoint that is publicly exposed, all the Plaid webhooks will work.

ngrok's free account has a session limit of 8 hours. To fully test out some of the transaction webhook workflows, you will need to get a more persistent endpoint as noted above when using the development environment.
