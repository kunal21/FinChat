# Plaid Pattern - Client

The client-side code demonstrates a [Plaid Link](https://plaid.com/docs/#integrating-with-link) integration. It is written using [React](https://reactjs.org/) (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)). The app runs on port 3000 by default, although you can modify this in [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml).
