# Plaid Pattern - Database

The database is a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) instance running inside a Docker container.

Port 5432 is exposed to the Docker host, so you can connect to the DB using the tool of your choice.
Username and password can be found in [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml).
