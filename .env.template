# Set the PLAID_SANDBOX_REDIRECT_URI below to 'http://localhost:3000/oauth-link'.
# The OAuth redirect flow requires an endpoint on the developer's website
# that the bank website should redirect to. You will need to configure
# this redirect URI for your client ID through the Plaid developer dashboard
# at https://dashboard.plaid.com/team/api.
# When running in development mode, you must use an https://.  In this case,
# set the PLAID_DEVELOPMENT_REDIRECT_URI to 'https://localhost:3000/oauth-link'.
# You will need to configure this https:// redirect URI in the Plaid developer dashboard.
