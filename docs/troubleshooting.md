# Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing oddities in the app, here are some common problems and their possible solutions.

## Common Issues

## I get a 409 error when linking a duplicate institution for the same user

Plaid Pattern has implemented server logic such that duplicate account linkages are prohibited. See [preventing item duplication](https://github.com/plaid/pattern/tree/master/server#preventing-item-duplication) section for more information.

## I can't access the Plaid Development environment API.\*\*

Before you can access the Development environment, you will need to request access via the [Plaid Dashboard](https://dashboard.plaid.com/overview/development).
